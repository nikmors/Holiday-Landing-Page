# Holiday-Landing-Page
A Holiday landing page:  HTML/CSS Animation/Js  A text animation created in Adobe XD. The SVG code has been extracted to create the HTML tags and then apply the animation with CSS.  An SVG animation using stroke dash array and stroke dash offset to create a cool effect. In the end of the clip, there are two pictures related to our summer holiday theme. The two images slide in the end of the text animation, thanks to CSS Animation. We only use the Js here as a tool to help us gather information about the total length of the specific strokes from the stroke-dasharray of every letter we want to animate. Check it out.
